# Netflix Data Analysis with SQL

This project focuses on analyzing Netflix's viewing patterns, content performance, and user behavior using SQL. The analysis aims to uncover key insights into how different types of content perform across regions, as well as patterns in user engagement and demographics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to use SQL to explore Netflix's dataset and extract meaningful insights that could inform content strategy, improve user engagement, and optimize Netflix's recommendation algorithms.


## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: Used SQL queries to extract, clean, and analyze the data.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Performed data cleaning and transformation using SQL functions such as `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `CASE`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed content performance, user demographics, and viewing trends using advanced SQL queries.

## SQL Queries & Analysis

This repository includes the SQL queries I used to perform the analysis, as well as insights derived from the data. Key SQL functions used:
- `JOIN` to merge tables (e.g., user data, content ratings, and subscription data).
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to aggregate and filter data.
- Subqueries to calculate metrics like average watch time and engagement rates.
- Window functions like `RANK()` for ranking content by popularity.

## How to Run the Queries
